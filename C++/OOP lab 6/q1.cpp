// Write a program to create a class CIRCLE with one field as radius, used to calculate the area of a Circle.
//  Create another class RECTANGLE used to calculate the area of the rectangle which is a subclass of CIRCLE class.
//  Use the concept of single inheritance such that the radius of circle class can be re-used as length in
//  rectangle class. Take necessary data members and member functions for both the classes to solve this problem. .
//  Show the result by accessing the area method of both the classes through the objects of rectangle class
